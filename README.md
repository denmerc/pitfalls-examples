# Pitfalls Examples

Examples for "Pitfalls and opportunities of single-page applications".

All examples are, on purpose, incomplete in various ways. For examples, loading hires images as thumbnails and on mobile is silly, but simplifies the setup enough to make it useful for demonstration purposes.

## Running

Needs `node` and `npm`. Run `npm install` to get dependencies.

Run `node server.js` or `./server.js` to start development server.

Better yet, `npm install nodemon -g` and run just `nodemon`. In this case, you only have to restart manually when changing templates.
